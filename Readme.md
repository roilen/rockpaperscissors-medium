# RockPaperScissors Game
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Java. Test your luck and strategy against the computer in this classic game!

## Description
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

* Rock (a fist)
* Paper (an open hand)
* Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended)

The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie:

* Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
* Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
* Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
In the case where both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually played again.
